In this project we working with multiple threading, there are N philosophers on a table, each one has a left and right fotk, for example we have 4 philosophers and 4 forks, each one of them must eat using the 2 forks, that means if one eating, the following one must waiting until finish and drop the fork then can start eating.

if someone can't eat in a time we pass as argument to the program, the philosopher will be die and the emulation will stop.

./philo N timeToEat timeToSleep timeToDie

N: represent the number of philosophers.
